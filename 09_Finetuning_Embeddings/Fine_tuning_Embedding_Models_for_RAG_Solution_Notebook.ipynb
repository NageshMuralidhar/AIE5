The model was trained on 2,788,000 H800 GPU hours at an estimated cost of $5,576,000. Llama 3.1 405B trained 30,840,000 GPU hours—11x that used by DeepSeek v3, for a model that benchmarks slightly worse.'),\n",

        "Here’s a detailed analysis comparing the `base_result` and `ft_result` dictionaries, including percentage changes for each metric.\n",
        "\n",
        "## 1. Context Recall\n",
        "- **Base Result:** 0.7816\n",
        "- **Fine-tuned Result:** 0.7955\n",
        "- **Percentage Change:** +1.79%\n",
        "- **Analysis:** The fine-tuned model shows a slight improvement in context recall, indicating that it is better at retrieving relevant contexts related to the questions posed. This suggests that the fine-tuning process has enhanced the model's ability to understand and recall relevant information from the context.\n",
        "\n",
        "## 2. Faithfulness\n",
        "- **Base Result:** 0.9268\n",
        "- **Fine-tuned Result:** 0.9335\n",
        "- **Percentage Change:** +0.76%\n",
        "- **Analysis:** The fine-tuned model also demonstrates a higher faithfulness score, which means it is more likely to provide answers that are consistent with the provided context. This improvement indicates that the fine-tuning has helped the model maintain accuracy in its responses, ensuring that the information it provides aligns closely with the context.\n",
        "\n",
        "## 3. Factual Correctness\n",
        "- **Base Result:** 0.6267\n",
        "- **Fine-tuned Result:** 0.6333\n",
        "- **Percentage Change:** +1.05%\n",
        "- **Analysis:** There is a marginal increase in factual correctness in the fine-tuned model. While both models have relatively low scores in this area, the fine-tuned model is slightly better at providing factually accurate information. This suggests that the fine-tuning process has had a positive impact on the model's ability to deliver correct information.\n",
        "\n",
        "## 4. Answer Relevancy\n",
        "- **Base Result:** 0.7774\n",
        "- **Fine-tuned Result:** 0.8559\n",
        "- **Percentage Change:** +10.06%\n",
        "- **Analysis:** The fine-tuned model shows a significant improvement in answer relevancy. This indicates that the responses generated by the fine-tuned model are more pertinent to the questions asked, suggesting that the fine-tuning has effectively enhanced the model's ability to generate contextually appropriate answers.\n",
        "\n",
        "## 5. Context Entity Recall\n",
        "- **Base Result:** 0.4477\n",
        "- **Fine-tuned Result:** 0.4366\n",
        "- **Percentage Change:** -2.48%\n",
        "- **Analysis:** Interestingly, the fine-tuned model shows a slight decrease in context entity recall. This metric measures the model's ability to identify and recall specific entities within the context. The drop may suggest that while the fine-tuned model is better at generating relevant answers, it may not be as effective at recognizing specific entities within the context.\n",
        "\n",
        "## 6. Noise Sensitivity Relevant\n",
        "- **Base Result:** 0.2554\n",
        "- **Fine-tuned Result:** 0.2491\n",
        "- **Percentage Change:** -2.47%\n",
        "- **Analysis:** The fine-tuned model has a lower score in noise sensitivity relevant, indicating that it may be slightly less affected by irrelevant or noisy information in the context. This could imply that the fine-tuning has helped the model focus more on relevant information, although the overall scores in this area are low for both models.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Summary\n",
        "Overall, the fine-tuned model demonstrates improvements in most metrics, particularly in context recall, faithfulness, and answer relevancy, with percentage changes of +1.79%, +0.76%, and +10.06%, respectively. These enhancements suggest that the fine-tuning process has effectively improved the model's ability to generate accurate and relevant responses based on the provided context. However, the slight decreases in context entity recall and noise sensitivity relevant, with percentage changes of -2.48% and -2.47%, indicate areas where the model may need further refinement.\n",
        "\n",
        "In conclusion, the fine-tuned model appears to be a better performer overall, especially in generating relevant and contextually accurate answers, which is crucial for applications requiring high-quality information retrieval and response generation."
