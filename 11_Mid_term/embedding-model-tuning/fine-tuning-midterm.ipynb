Additionally, they can help generate training data for smaller, more cost-effective models by leveraging larger models to create high-quality examples.\\n\\nHowever, the key to maximizing the utility of LLMs lies in understanding their power and unreliability. Users must develop skills to navigate their flaws and avoid pitfalls.
