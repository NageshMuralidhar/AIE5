When examining the information related to human intelligence, it's essential to consider the evolutionary perspective. The study suggesting a decline in human cognition over time raises crucial questions about intelligence trends. However, we must critically assess the study's methodology and sample size to validate its findings. How can we ensure the accuracy of such studies and their implications for human cognition?<br><br>[Transition to Subjectivity in Judging Intelligence]</code>                       |
